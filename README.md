## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

* Node.js 18+ (required for Payload CMS 3.0)
* An active Railway account
* A Railway API token (create one at [railway.app/account/tokens](https://railway.app/account/tokens))
* Basic familiarity with Payload CMS 3.0 concepts

### 2. Configure Cursor

To use with Cursor IDE:

1. Open Cursor Settings
2. Go to MCP Servers section
3. Add a new MCP server
4. Name it "Payload CMS 3.0 MCP"
5. Set Transport Type to "Command"
6. Set Command to: `railway run --service=YOUR_SERVICE_ID`
7. Save the configuration

### 3. Using the MCP Server

Once configured, you can use these tools in your AI prompts:

* **Code Validation:** "Validate this Payload CMS collection code"
* **Template Generation:** "Generate a template for a media collection"
* **Query Rules:** "Query validation rules for access control"
* **SQL-like Queries:** "Execute a query to find field types for collections"

### 4. Example Workflow

A typical workflow with the Payload CMS MCP Server:

1. Generate a collection template with specific fields
2. Validate the generated code for best practices
3. Query for specific validation rules to improve the code
4. Generate additional components like hooks or endpoints
5. Scaffold a complete project structure when ready

### 5. Complete Workflow Example

Here's a complete example of how you might use the MCP server in a conversation:

```
User: I need to create a Payload CMS collection for a product catalog.

AI: I'll help you create a product catalog collection. Let me generate a template for you.

[Uses generate_collection tool]

Here's a collection template for your product catalog:

```typescript
import { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types';

export const Products: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'products',
  admin: {
    useAsTitle: 'name',
    defaultColumns: ['name', 'price', 'category', 'inStock'],
    group: 'Shop',
  },
  access: {
    read: () => true,
  },
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'name',
      type: 'text',
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'description',
      type: 'richText',
    },
    {
      name: 'price',
      type: 'number',
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'category',
      type: 'relationship',
      relationTo: 'categories',
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'images',
      type: 'array',
      fields: [
        {
          name: 'image',
          type: 'upload',
          relationTo: 'media',
          required: true,
        },
        {
          name: 'altText',
          type: 'text',
          required: true,
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      name: 'inStock',
      type: 'checkbox',
      defaultValue: true,
    },
  ],
  timestamps: true,
}
```

User: Can you validate this code to make sure it follows best practices?

AI: I'll validate the code for you.

[Uses validate tool]

The validation results show that your code is valid and follows best practices. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Consider adding a maxDepth to your category relationship field to prevent deep queries
2. You might want to add access control for create, update, and delete operations
3. Consider adding hooks for inventory management when products are updated

User: What are the best practices for access control in Payload CMS?

AI: Let me query the validation rules for access control.

[Uses query tool]

Here are the best practices for access control in Payload CMS:

1. Always define explicit access control functions for create, read, update, and delete operations
2. Use role-based access control for admin users
3. Implement field-level access control for sensitive data
4. Use collection-level access control for broad permissions
5. Consider using hooks alongside access control for complex logic

User: Now I need to scaffold a complete project with this product collection and a categories collection.

AI: I'll scaffold a complete project for you.

[Uses scaffold_project tool]

I've generated a complete Payload CMS project structure with the following:

- Product collection as you specified
- Categories collection with name and description fields
- Media collection for product images
- Authentication for admin users
- TypeScript configuration
- MongoDB database setup
- All necessary files and configurations

The project is ready to be initialized with `npm install` and `npm run dev`.
